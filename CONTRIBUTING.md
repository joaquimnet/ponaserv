## Pull Request Guidelines

- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `main`, and merge back against that branch.

- If fixing bug:

  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - GitHub can automatically squash them before merging.

- Commit messages must follow be in the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format so that changelogs can be automatically generated.
